## Building

To build the project, you need to set the `GDWeavePath` environment variable to your game install's GDWeave directory (e.g. `G:\games\steam\steamapps\common\WEBFISHING\GDWeave`). This can also be done in Rider with `File | Settings | Build, Execution, Deployment | Toolset and Build | MSBuild global properties` or with a .user file in Visual Studio.
